## Description

Golang package - client library for the [snmpsim](https://github.com/etingof/snmpsim) [REST API](https://github.com/etingof/snmpsim-control-plane).

The library is used by [snmpsim-control-client](https://github.com/inexio/snmpsim-control-client) and [snmpsim-check](https://github.com/inexio/snmpsim-check).

This go client is an open-source library to communicate with the snmpsim REST API which is written in Python.

## Code Style

This project was written according to the **[uber-go](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)** coding style.

## Features

### Management Client

- Create laboratory environments to test SNMP calls
- Configuration of laboratory environments
- Possibility to create Endpoints, Engines, Agents, Users and Tags
- Agents can be added to Laboratories
- Engines can be added to Agents
- Users and Endpoints can be added to Engines
- Tags can be applied to all of the above 
- Possibility to delete all objects linked to a tag (for cleanup purposes)

### Metrics Client

- Can check metrics of a lab environment
- Possibility to check processes, packet activity and message activity

## Requirements

The latest version of the snmpsim python module needs to be installed and configured.

Further information on how to download and configure snmpsim can be found [here](https://github.com/etingof/snmpsim).

Snmpsim-control-plane has to be installed and running. A guide for setting Control Plane can be found [here](http://snmplabs.com/snmpsim-control-plane/deployment.html).

To check if your setup works, follow the steps provided in the **'Tests'** section of this document.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/inexio/snmpsim-restapi-go-client
```

or 

```Â 
git clone https://github.com/inexio/snmpsim-restapi-go-client.git
```

## Usage

### Management Client

```go
	//Create a new management api client
	client, err := snmpsimclient.NewManagementClient("https://127.0.0.1:8000")
	
	//Set http auth username and password (optional)
	err = client.SetUsernameAndPassword("httpAuthUsername", "httpAuthPassword")

	//Create a new lab
	lab, err := client.CreateLab("myLab") //optionally use CreateLabWithTag(..., tagId) [tagId as last param]

	//Create a new engine
	engine, err := client.CreateEngine("myEngine", "0102030405070809") //optionally use CreateEngineWithTag(..., tagId) [tagId as last param]

	//Create a new endpoint
	endpoint, err := client.CreateEndpoint("myEndpoint", "127.0.0.1", "1234") //optionally use CreateEndpointWithTag(..., tagId) [tagId as last param]

	//Create a new user
	user, err := client.CreateUser("uniqueUserIdentifier", "myUser", "", "", "", "") //optionally use CreateUserWithTag(..., tagId) [tagId as last param]

	//Add user to engine
	err = client.AddUserToEngine(engine.ID, user.ID)

	//Add endpoint to engine
	err = client.AddEndpointToEngine(engine.ID, endpoint.ID)

	//Create a new agent
	agent, err := client.CreateAgent("myAgent", "agent/data/dir") //optionally use CreateAgentWithTag(..., tagId) [tagId as last param]


	//Add engine to agent
	err = client.AddEngineToAgent(agent.ID, engine.ID)

	//Add agent to lab
	err = client.AddAgentToLab(lab.ID, agent.ID)

	//Set lab power on
	err = client.SetLabPower(lab.ID, true)
	
	//Delete lab
	err = client.DeleteLab(lab.ID)
```

### Metrics Client

```go
	//Create a new metrics api client
	client, err := snmpsimclient.NewMetricsClient("https://127.0.0.1:8001")

	//Set http auth username and password (optional)
	err = client.SetUsernameAndPassword("httpAuthUsername", "httpAuthPassword")

	//Get all packet metrics
	packets, err := client.GetPackets(nil)

	//Get all possible filters for packets
	packetFilters, err := client.GetPacketFilters()
	
	//Get all packets for endpoint "127.0.0.1:1234"
	filters := make(map[string]string)
	filters["local_address"] = "127.0.0.1:1234"
	packets, err := client.GetPackets(filters)

	//Get all message metrics
	messages, err := client.GetMessages(nil)
```



### Tests

Our library provides a few unit and integration tests. To use these tests, the yaml config files in the test-data directory must be adapted to your setup.

In order to run these test, run the follwing command inside root directory of this repository:

```
go test
```



If you want to check if your setup works, run:

```
go test -run TestManagementClient_buildUpSetupAndTestIt
```
